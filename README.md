QEngine is a template for making games with Processing.

To use it, you will need:

 * The Processing Development Environment v1.5.1, from <http://processing.org/>

Open QEngine.pde in Processing and hit the run button!
Not much will happen until you add custom game code.

I reccomend starting by poking around in ExampleState.pde, which runs by default.
